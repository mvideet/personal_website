# Background

Chain-of-Thought(CoT), Tree-of-Thought(ToT), Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning have well been known to be state-of-the-art reasoning algorithms. These reasoning algorithms perform reasoning at the discrete token level, meaning that they produce discrete tokens to power their reasoning. However, previous research has shown that the leaving reasoning chains in the latent space can encode many reasoning paths without having to convert it back to discretized tokens. 

Performing reasoning at this much denser latent space will be able to compress reasoning chains while preserving the exploration & exploitation of traditional reasoning methods.

This blog post will dive into the Xiaomi paper, **Think Silently, Think Fast: Dynamic Latent Compression of LLM Reasoning Chains** by Tan et. al. 

## Latent Space
In LLMs, a **latent space** is a continuous, high-dimensional vector space where the model internally represents language and reasoning.
Each input token $t_i$ is embedded as
