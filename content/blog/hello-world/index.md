# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings with you. This blog will be a space where I document my journey in computer science, explore interesting problems, and share insights from my experiences.

## What You Can Expect

Here are some topics I plan to cover:

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Deep dives into NLP, LLMs, and cutting-edge research
- **Computer Science Fundamentals**: Algorithms, data structures, and system design
- **Project Walkthroughs**: Behind-the-scenes looks at my projects and the challenges I faced
- **Learning Resources**: Books, papers, and tools that have helped me grow
- **Personal Reflections**: Thoughts on technology, education, and life as a student

## A Bit About Me

I'm currently studying Computer Science at MIT, with a particular interest in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. I love building things that solve real problems and exploring the intersection of technology and human communication.

## Stay Connected

I'll be updating this blog regularly with new content. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about technology!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something valuable here.
