- Developed a multivariate ridge-regularized model to forecast hyperscale data-center load, isolating demand anomalies across industrial, residential, and weather variables. Modeling ~60% of future data-center load accurately.
- Implemented GPU optimizations via building my own CUDA kernels for loading large weather foundation models onto limited GPU compute. Cut down fine-tuning costs but 50%.
- Designed a next-gen AI architecture combining graph and sequence modeling to capture complex power grid dynamics to predict eletricity marginal prices (LMPs), outperforming existing industry benchmarks by nearly 25% on MAE/RMSE metrics.
