- Built a PEFT multimodal AVSR pipeline by integrating Av-HuBERT visual embeddings with gated cross-attention layers, achieving a 15% relative WER reduction in noisy settings.
- Orchestrated distributed training and large-scale experiments using SLURM across multi-GPU clusters to benchmark performance across model configurations.
- Designed a sparse attention-vector routing system on top of Qwen2.5-Omni, enabling dynamic selection of high-signal attention heads for audio classification tasks.
